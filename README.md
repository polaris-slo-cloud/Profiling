# Profiling
Tools and case study for workload profiling.
In the folder ``profiling,'' we include the experiments on the Google Cloud Dataset.
In the folder ``ml_data-profiling,'' we report the case study on the Alibaba ML workload dataset. This last repository contains the results published in the paper "PolarisProfiler: A Novel Metadata-Based Profiling Approach for Optimizing Resource Management in the Edge-Cloud Continnum" which will be presented @IEEE SOSE 2023, Athens, Greece.
